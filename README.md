## As part of the internship project under CodTech, the assigned task was to build and visualize a Decision Tree model using the Scikit-learn library in Python to classify or predict outcomes based on a chosen dataset. This task aimed to provide hands-on experience in applying supervised machine learning techniques using Python and its associated data science libraries. The Decision Tree algorithm is one of the most intuitive and powerful classification tools, which works by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the value of input features, thus creating a tree-like structure where each node represents a decision rule. For this project, the widely used Iris dataset was selected due to its simplicity and suitability for multi-class classification problems. The Iris dataset contains 150 samples from three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, each with four features — sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The development environment used for this project was either Jupyter Notebook or PyCharm, depending on user preference. The tools and libraries used included Scikit-learn for machine learning operations, Pandas for handling data in a structured tabular format, Matplotlib for data visualization, and optionally Seaborn for enhanced graphical output. The implementation started by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset using load_iris() from Scikit-learn. The dataset was then converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easier handling and exploration. Features and labels were separated, and the data was split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split() method. A Decision Tree Classifier was instantiated and trained using the training data, and predictions were made on the test set. The performance of the model was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix. In this particular implementation, the model achieved a perfect accuracy score of 100% on the test data, demonstrating its ability to correctly classify all the samples. Furthermore, to enhance interpretability, the trained decision tree was visualized using the plot_tree() function from Scikit-learn’s tree module. The visual representation of the decision tree showed how the model splits the dataset based on feature thresholds, leading to different class predictions at the leaf nodes. This visualization is crucial for understanding how decision-making is performed internally by the model and is especially useful for educational and analytical purposes. Additionally, feature importance values were extracted to analyze which input features contributed the most to the decision-making process. Overall, this task reinforced the foundational concepts of machine learning workflows including data preprocessing, model training, testing, evaluation, and visualization. It also emphasized the importance of model explainability, especially in real-world applications where stakeholders need to understand how predictions are made. Successfully completing this project not only provided valuable technical exposure to the Scikit-learn ecosystem but also strengthened analytical thinking and problem-solving skills necessary for working with AI models in a professional setting.
